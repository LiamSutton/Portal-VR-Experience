# Portal-VR-Experience

This project was created as part of my VR / 3D uni module and is meant to be played using a GVR device although it works well through the Unity editor.
All assets were pulled by decompiling the PC version of portal 1.
Models were textured using blender and then imported into Unity wherein the animations were implemented.
